/* The convex hull of a set of N points is the smallest perimeter fenceenclosing the points.
 * Equivalent definitions:
 *      - Smallest convex set containing all the points.
 *      - Smallest area convex polygon enclosing the points.
 *      - Convex polygon enclosing the points, whose vertices are points in set.
